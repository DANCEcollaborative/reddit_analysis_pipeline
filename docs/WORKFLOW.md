**This document describes three workflows:
  1. How data is scraped from reddit directly into Discoursedb without analysis
  2. How data is scraped from reddit, analyzed, piped through discoursedb into a visualization engine
  3. A *planned* pipeline that routes data through DiscourseDB before analysis
